# php--MVC


This is a hand-crafted php application with MVC structure. A list of books are displayed with links to individual books.

A search box was added for search of books with names containing certain words.


In the /model folder, Model.php takes care of connection to database and fetching data, whereas Book.php specifies the class of Book.
